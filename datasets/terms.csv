moffen,Dutch,In Dutch the most common term for the German people after the regular/official one is mof. It is regarded as a derogative term used exclusively for Germans and reflected Dutch resentment of the German occupation of the Netherlands during the Second World War and the respective German actions. The word Mofrika (Germany) is a portmanteau of Africa and mof. In the late 16th century the area now known as East Frisia and Emsland and the people that lived there were referred to as Muffe. At the time that the Netherlands were by far the richest country in the whole of Europe and these people were looked down upon greatly by the Dutch. The area of Western Lower Saxony was at that time very poor and a good source for many Dutch people looking for cheap labour. The inhabitants of this region were known to be rather reserved and were often described as grumpy rude and unsophisticated by the Dutch. Later the term was used to describe the whole of Germany which at the time wasnt much better off economically than Western Lower Saxony mainly due to the various wars waged on its territory by foreign powers. The term seemed to have died out around 1900 but returned following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940. A popular humorous (but false) etymology of the word mof by the Dutch is that it is actually a German abbreviation meaning Menschen ohne Freunde (people without friends).,Nationality,Germany

poebe,Northern Frisian,A person of German descent. In Frisian (minority) language and Gronings dialect the word poep or poebe is used as well as poepelân (Fr.) poepenlaand (Gr.) for Germany itself. In Gronings and Dutch poep means faeces though the word does not seem to originate from that. A theory is that when Bernhard von Galen and his Westphalian troops arrived at Groningen in the 17th century to conquer the city they used the word Puppe (meaning puppet). The people from Groningen laughed about that because it sounds exactly like poebe which means faeces. Another theory is that it originates from that same era but from the word Bube being a fondle word for boy. From the city of Groningen it spread out into the province of Groningen and the border region with Drenthe.,Nationality,Germany
